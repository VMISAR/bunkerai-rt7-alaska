# BunkerAI-RT7 Alaska Edition — Full Build Log

*Oukitel RT7 Titan 5G | SanDisk Extreme 512GB | Interior Alaska*

---

## Build Overview

**Mission:** Build a fully self-contained, air-gapped survival intelligence terminal on the Oukitel RT7 Titan 5G that exceeds the commercial BunkerAI "BOB" tablet in every operationally relevant category — battery life, ruggedness, AI capability, and open architecture — at roughly half the cost.

**Design constraints that govern every decision:**

- **Zero-Dark-Access:** No internet connection required for any function. No towers, no cloud, no cellular.
- **Single Interface:** All tools accessible from one unified launcher. One purpose, one screen.
- **Open Architecture:** No locked models, no proprietary apps, no vendor dependency.
- **Alaska-Hardened:** Specs, content, maps, and use cases tuned for Interior Alaska — extreme cold, long winter nights, remote terrain, grid-down scenarios.

**Setup machine:** MacBook Air (macOS)
**Transfer method:** ADB (Android Debug Bridge) over USB-C

## Phase 0 — First Boot Protocol

*Completed: March 16, 2026*

### Hardware State at Start

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Device | Oukitel RT7 Titan 5G |
| Serial | RT7TITANA1506745 |
| Chipset | MediaTek MT6853 / Dimensity 720 (ARM64) |
| RAM | 12GB LPDDR4X physical |
| Storage | 256GB internal |
| Firmware | OUKITEL_RT7_TITAN_5G_EEA_A15_V07_20250910 |
| OS | Android 15 |
| Firmware Variant | EEA (European Economic Area) with NFC |

### First Boot Sequence

The RT7 was powered on for the first time and taken through Android's initial setup with deliberate choices. **The device was kept offline and account-free throughout.**

> Connecting to Wi-Fi or signing into Google during first boot triggers background syncs, account bindings, and telemetry. The device was kept offline and account-free to avoid these complications.

| Setup Screen | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | English | Standard |
| Wi-Fi | Skipped — no network connected | Prevent background sync on first boot |
| Google Account | Skipped | Prevent account binding and cloud backup |
| Google Services | All declined | Eliminate telemetry at OS level |
| PIN | Set | Required for ADB auth and kiosk lockdown |
| Oukitel screens | All skipped | No manufacturer cloud services needed |

### ADB Setup on MacBook Air

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not present)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install ADB
brew install android-platform-tools

# Verify
adb version
# Expected: Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 or higher
```

### Enable USB Debugging on RT7

1. Settings → About Tablet → Build Number — tap 7 times
2. Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging → **ON**
3. Settings → Developer Options → Stay Awake → **ON** (keeps screen on during transfers)
4. Connect RT7 to Mac via Anker PowerLine III Flow USB-C
5. On RT7: allow the connection, select "Always allow from this computer"

```bash
# Verify connection
adb devices
# Expected: RT7TITANA1506745   device
# If "unauthorized": check RT7 screen for Allow popup
```

### Pre-Build Package Snapshot

Before any changes, export the complete package list as the permanent before-state record:

```bash
adb shell pm list packages > ~/Desktop/rt7_packages.txt
```

> Keep this file permanently. It is the reference for any restore operation if something breaks.

---

## Phase 0b — Debloat Attempt

*Completed (and undone): March 16, 2026*

> **⚠️ SKIP THIS PHASE. The debloat caused a boot loop. This phase is documented for the community record, not as a step to repeat. The build works without debloat. Jump to Phase 0c if you need recovery, or Phase 1 for a clean start.**

### What Was Attempted

ADB debloat using `adb shell pm uninstall --user 0` to remove Google consumer apps, Google Assistant, Oukitel manufacturer preloads, and Android system bloat (screen savers, live wallpaper, SIM toolkit, print spooler, NFC service).

The `--user 0` flag hides packages from the primary user profile without deleting them from the system partition — theoretically reversible. Every removal was verified against the package snapshot first.

**Why it seemed safe:** The `--user 0` method had worked on other Android devices without issues.

### What Broke It

Removing `com.android.nfc` and one or more of the following system packages triggered a boot loop:

```
com.android.nfc
com.android.printspooler
com.android.dreams.basic
com.android.wallpaper.livepicker
com.android.stk
com.android.soundrecorder
com.android.dreams.phototable
```

**Root cause:** On MediaTek MT6853 / Android 15 EEA builds, `com.android.nfc` appears to be coupled to a hardware initialization service that runs at boot before Android fully loads. Hiding it via `--user 0` caused the init sequence to fail.

**Result:** Device shows "Software corrupted — press power to boot" on every subsequent boot. Factory reset does not fix it — the corruption is in the `super.img` system partition, not userdata.

### What NOT to Debloat (If You Attempt This on Another Device)

Never remove these packages on the RT7 Titan:

| Package | Risk |
|---|---|
| `com.android.nfc` | **Causes boot loop on MT6853 EEA** |
| `com.google.android.gms` | Briar, Seek, others reference GMS at runtime |
| `com.android.camera2` | IR night vision — core build capability |
| `com.android.settings` | System becomes unconfigurable |
| `com.android.bluetooth` | Required for Briar + Meshtastic |
| `android.hardware.location.*` | Navigation foundation |

### Lesson

The Nova Launcher kiosk configuration (Phase 5) achieves the same clean interface without touching the system partition. It locks the device to approved apps, hides everything else, and removes the interface clutter. The debloat adds nothing the kiosk mode doesn't also deliver — but it can brick the device.

**Do not debloat the RT7 Titan.**

---

## Phase 0c — Firmware Recovery

*Completed: March 17, 2026*

### The Problem

Device in boot loop. Factory reset failed (userdata wipe can't fix system partition corruption). Bootloader locked. No root access. No Windows PC available. Nine recovery attempts exhausted before finding a path forward.

### Recovery Attempts — Full Log

#### Attempt 1 — Factory Reset via Recovery Mode
`adb reboot recovery` → Wipe data / Factory reset → Reboot
**Result: FAILED.** Factory reset only wipes userdata. Corruption is in `super.img`. Device returned to corrupt screen.

#### Attempt 2 — BROM Mode Entry (Multiple Methods)
BROM (Boot ROM) is the lowest-level MediaTek recovery mode — bypasses the bootloader entirely.

Methods tried: Volume Down + plug USB, Volume Up + plug USB, Volume Up + Volume Down + plug USB, plug first then Volume Down, all held 10–15 seconds.

**Result: FAILED.** BROM mode on this device likely requires precise timing or a physical PCB test point short. Cannot be forced externally without disassembly.

*Note: mtkclient `devices` returned a Wiko Lenny 4 entry — this was a cached entry in mtkclient's local database, not a live device. The RT7 was never detected by mtkclient.*

#### Attempt 3 — Fastboot Flash (Full Partition Set)
`adb reboot bootloader` → `fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img`
**Result: FAILED.** `Writing 'vbmeta_a' FAILED (remote: 'not allowed in locked state')` — bootloader locked.

#### Attempt 4 — Fastboot OEM Unlock
`fastboot flashing unlock`
First attempt: `FAILED (remote: 'Unlock operation is not allowed')`
Second attempt: `OKAY [9.208s]` — appeared to succeed.
Follow-up: `fastboot getvar unlocked` → `unlocked: no`

**Result: FAILED.** The unlock command was accepted but didn't persist. `oem_unlock_enabled` was never set to 1 in Developer Options before the device stopped booting. The bootloader requires this flag set from within the OS before it honors the fastboot unlock command.

#### Attempt 5 — ADB Settings Command to Enable OEM Unlock
```bash
adb shell settings put global oem_unlock_enabled 1
adb shell settings get global oem_unlock_enabled
```
**Result: FAILED.** Command ran without error but didn't persist after reboot. Android was not fully booted when ADB connected — settings database not in a writable state.

#### Attempt 6 — Legacy Fastboot OEM Unlock Command
`fastboot oem unlock`
**Result: FAILED.** `FAILED (remote: 'unknown command')` — this bootloader doesn't support the legacy syntax.

#### Attempt 7 — Flash boot.img Only (Locked Bootloader)
`fastboot flash boot boot.img`
**Result: FAILED.** `FAILED (remote: 'not allowed in locked state')` — no partition is exempt from locked state restriction on this bootloader.

#### Attempt 8 — ADB Root / DD Write to Block Devices
All partitions visible via `adb shell ls /dev/block/by-name/` (super, boot_a, boot_b, vbmeta_a, etc.)
```bash
adb root      # "adbd cannot run as root in production builds"
adb shell su  # "su: inaccessible or not found"
```
**Result: FAILED.** Production build, no su binary. ADB runs as `uid=2000(shell)`. Block device writes require root.

#### Attempt 9 — Recovery Mode ADB Root
`adb reboot recovery` → attempt `adb root` from recovery
**Result: Inconclusive.** Timed out before commands could be executed — recovery menu auto-dismissed. Recovery mode ADB root was not confirmed or denied.

### Resolution

**Option taken: [PLACEHOLDER — document which option you used: A (Windows + SP Flash Tool), B (PCB test point), C (recovery ADB root), or D (Oukitel support)]**

**Available firmware files used:**

| File | Version | Date |
|---|---|---|
| TP758_OQ_P07_NFC_6853_TO_EEA_V1.4.8_S251017.zip | V1.4.8 | Oct 2025 |

Firmware path on Mac: `/Users/Jason/MEGA downloads/RT7 TITAN 5G A13 带NFC/TP758_OQ_P07_NFC_6853_T0_EEA_V1.4.8_S251017/`

Key files confirmed present in ZIP:
- `MT6853_Android_scatter.txt` — partition map
- `super.img` — 5.1GB — contains the Android OS
- `preloader_tp758_oq_p07_nfc_6853_t0_eea.bin`
- All partition images (boot, vbmeta, dtbo, gz, lk, etc.)

### Post-Recovery Device State

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Firmware | V1.4.8 clean baseline |
| Android | 15 — fresh install |
| USB Debugging | Re-enabled |
| ADB Connection | Working — MacBook Air confirmed |
| Build String | OUKITEL_RT7_TITAN_5G_EEA_A15_V07_20250910 (or newer post-flash) |

> The build proceeds without any debloat. The Nova Launcher kiosk mode handles the interface lockdown cleanly without touching system packages.

### Bunker Drive — Content

**Root:** `/Volumes/Bunker/BunkerAI/`

#### Project Gutenberg LCC Volumes → `/Volumes/Bunker/BunkerAI/ZIM/gutenberg/`

Rather than downloading the 206GB English monolith, downloaded by Library of Congress Classification subject code. Each is a standalone ZIM file.

> **Why Gutenberg matters for survival:** A 19th century farming almanac assumes you have no tractor. An 1890 medical textbook assumes you have no hospital. An 1870 construction manual assumes you have hand tools and timber. This is exactly the knowledge profile needed for long-term grid-down operations — it was written for the scenario.

| File | Size | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-q_2026-03.zim` | 17GB | Science — biology, botany, zoology, natural history, geology |
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-t_2026-03.zim` | 12GB | Technology — engineering, construction, forge work, masonry |
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-a_2026-03.zim` | 9.1GB | General Works — encyclopedias, almanacs, reference collections |
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-g_2026-03.zim` | 7.5GB | Geography — exploration, wilderness travel, indigenous land use |
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-s_2026-03.zim` | 4.2GB | Agriculture — farming, animal husbandry, food preservation, forestry |
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-r_2026-03.zim` | 1.9GB | Medicine — pre-modern medical texts, herbal medicine, wound management |
| `gutenberg_en_lcc-u_2026-03.zim` | 1.2GB | Military Science — field craft, fortification, logistics, tactics |

#### CD3WD Pre-Industrial Knowledge ISOs → `/Volumes/Bunker/BunkerAI/CD3WD/`

Six DVD ISO files (~26GB total). CD3WD = CD3 World Development — compiled to help developing-world communities achieve basic infrastructure without imported technology.

> **Why CD3WD is different from everything else in this build:** Every other reference assumes you have something from the modern world — a vehicle, a drug, a replacement part. CD3WD assumes you have raw materials, hand tools, and time.

Content includes: hand-dug wells and gravity-fed water systems, pit sawing and timber framing, soap and candle making, grain processing and fermentation, food preservation without refrigeration, basic blacksmithing, hide tanning, rope from plant fiber, brick and mortar from local materials.

| File | Size |
|---|---|
| `1001_cd3wd.iso` | 4.3GB |
| `1002_cd3wd.iso` | 4.3GB |
| `1003_cd3wd.iso` | 4.3GB |
| `1004_cd3wd.iso` | 4.3GB |
| `1005_cd3wd.iso` | 4.3GB |
| `1006_cd3wd.iso` | 4.4GB |

> **Format note:** CD3WD files are ISO disk images, not ZIM files. They don't open in Kiwix. Use the Amaze File Manager APK (included in the build) to browse ISO contents directly, or extract before transfer: `hdiutil mount 1001_cd3wd.iso` on Mac.

#### Additional Stack Exchange ZIM Files → `/Volumes/Bunker/BunkerAI/ZIM/stackExchange/`

| File | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cooking.stackexchange.com_en_all_2026-02.zim` | 226MB | Food prep, preservation, ingredient substitutions |
| `gardening.stackexchange.com_en_all_2026-02.zim` | 882MB | Vegetable cultivation, soil management — Interior Alaska conditions |
| `sustainability.stackexchange.com_en_all_2026-02.zim` | 26MB | Off-grid systems, long-term self-sufficiency |
| `biology.stackexchange.com_en_all_2026-02.zim` | 403MB | Plant/animal ID, ecology, physiology |
| `engineering.stackexchange.com_en_all_2026-02.zim` | 242MB | Mechanical, civil, electrical, structural Q&A |

#### APK Files → `/Volumes/Bunker/BunkerAI/APKs/`

| File | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kiwix-3.10.0.apk` | 94MB | Kiwix Reader — must be installed before any ZIM is accessible |
| `VLC-Android-3.6.2-arm64-v8a.apk` | 45MB | VLC — ARM64 build for RT7 processor |

4. Test: point camera at any plant, confirm offline ID works

> **Foraging safety note:** Seek identifies species but does not always flag Alaska-specific toxicity. Always cross-reference any foraged plant against the ADFG Edible and Poisonous Plants PDF before consuming. Seek is an identification tool, not a safety guarantee.

---

## Phase 4 — Validation

*Status: PENDING*

All six layers must pass before final lockdown. Do not lock the device until all tests complete.

### Validation Tests

| Layer | Test | Pass Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| AI | Airplane Mode → Layla → laceration query | Full response under 90 seconds |
| Knowledge | Kiwix search: "hypothermia treatment" (Wikipedia) + "how to start a fire" (WikiHow) | Both resolve offline |
| Navigation | OsmAnd loads Alaska map → pin near Fairbanks → routing verified | Works fully offline |
| Topo Maps | Open a GeoPDF from `/sdcard/USGS_Topos/` | Contour lines and place names legible |
| Species ID | Seek → point at any plant | Offline identification confirmed |
| Comms (LoRa) | Meshtastic → pair with Heltec V3 → send + receive in Airplane Mode | LoRa (not Bluetooth) message confirmed |
| Comms (P2P) | Briar → pair with second device → send + receive in Airplane Mode | Message sent and received |
| Solar | FlexSolar 36W panel outdoors → battery % increases at 50% brightness | Net-positive charge confirmed; record rate and conditions |

### Inference Speed Benchmark

Record these after Phi-3 Mini load:

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Time to first token | < 15 seconds | |
| Full response — laceration query | < 90 seconds | |
| Token speed (tok/sec) | TBD | |

## Phase 5 — Final Lockdown

*Status: PENDING*

> **⚠️ RECORD YOUR PIN BEFORE ENABLING KIOSK MODE. Test all apps one final time before locking. Once kiosk mode is active, navigation is restricted to approved apps only.**

### Lockdown Sequence

1. Enable App Pinning: Settings → Security → App Pinning → Enable
2. Set Nova Launcher as Kiosk Controller: Nova Launcher Prime → Kiosk Mode → restrict to approved apps
3. Disable non-essential system apps: Play Store, Chrome, Gmail — installed but inaccessible
4. Disable connectivity: Wi-Fi off, Mobile Data off, NFC off → Airplane Mode as default state (Bluetooth enabled only for Meshtastic/Briar when in use)
5. Set Screen Timeout to maximum
6. Disable Lock Screen Notifications
7. Disable USB Debugging: Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging → **OFF**
8. Hide Developer Options — run before unplugging Mac:

```bash
adb shell settings put global development_settings_enabled 0
```

**Result:** Device powers on directly to Nova Launcher survival dashboard. No Google prompts, no notifications, no app store. Purpose-built offline survival intelligence terminal.
